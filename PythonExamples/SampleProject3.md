# Introduction to micro:bit: LEDs, Buzzers, and Buttons
Here's eginner-friendly micro project using Python that would be perfect for introducing middle school students to physical computing and robotics fundamentals.

## Project Overview
This program demonstrates four key components of a robotics curriculum:

Interactive LED Patterns - Visual feedback using the built-in LED matrix
Button Input - Reading and responding to physical inputs
Sound Generation - Creating tones and melodies with a buzzer
Game Development - Combining inputs and outputs to create engaging activities

## Educational Value
This project is structured as a teaching tool with:

Well-documented code with comments explaining each component
Progressive complexity from simple functions to more complex interactions
Modular design where students can modify individual sections
Interactive demos that make abstract concepts tangible

Classroom Implementation
- For beginners (6th grade): Start by demonstrating the finished program, then have students copy and modify the simple button_demo function
- For intermediate students (7th-8th grade): Have them enhance the existing demos by adding new patterns or sounds
- For advanced students (high school): Challenge them to create their own games or extend the reaction_game with scoring systems
