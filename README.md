## Age-Appropriate Adjustments
Elementary (K-5)
* More emphasis on pre-built robotics kits (LEGO WeDo, Dash & Dot)
* Simpler block-based programming
* More guided activities with less open-ended problem-solving
* Focus on basic cause and effect relationships

Middle School (6-8)
* Introduction to more complex kits (LEGO Mindstorms, VEX IQ)
* Mix of block-based and simple text-based programming
* More independent problem-solving
* Introduction to engineering concepts and physics

High School (9-12)
* Advanced platforms (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, VEX EDR)
* Text-based programming (Python, C++)
* Complex engineering challenges
* Introduction to AI and machine learning concepts

Materials Needed
* Age-appropriate robotics kits
* Computers/tablets for programming
* Basic electronics components (LEDs, resistors, breadboards)
* Craft supplies for building and customizing
* Challenge materials (obstacle courses, line-following tracks)

Assessment Methods
* Daily progress journals
* Project rubrics focusing on design, functionality, and creativity
* Peer feedback sessions
* Final project presentations

Sample Daily Schedule
* 9:00-9:30: Morning meeting and concept introduction
* 9:30-10:45: Guided instruction and demonstration
* 10:45-11:00: Break
* 11:00-12:15: Hands-on building/programming time
